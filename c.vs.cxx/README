This directory has benchmarks which compares standard c implementation of
an algorithm vs. standard c++ implementation of the same algorithm. The idea is
to first construct equivalent data structures in both C and C++ respectively,
and then call corresponding functions (e.g., string::find vs. strstr) to
measure performance.

Caveats:
- Effort has been made to discard any unwanted side-effects like malloc etc.
- The c library functions are called from the C++ programs
- c_alloc is a very primitive wrapper to hide malloc and free, it is intended
  to be very simple and used as such.
