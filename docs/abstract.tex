\title{Performance analysis and optimization of C$++$ standard libraries}
\date{}

\maketitle

\section{Summary}
We will present the performance analysis work on libc$++$ and libstdc$++$ and
the changes we did to the libraries and to the LLVM compiler to optimize the
code using the C$++$ standard libraries. This includes the improvements on
standard library algorithms like string::find,
libc$++$::basic\_streambuf::xsgetn, libc$++$::stringstream. These algorithms
were suboptimal and we improved those algorithms, particularly std::string::find
which improved by more than 10x as a result of our work. Similarly, we enabled
the inlining of constructor and destructor of libc$++$::std::string. We will
present a systematic analysis of function attributes in libc$++$ and the places
where we added missing attributes. We will present comparative analysis of
libc$++$ vs. libstdc$++$ on commonly used algorithms, and show cases where
std::sort of libstdc$++$ performs much better than that of libc$++$.

We will talk about std-benchmark (https://github.com/hiraditya/std-benchmark)
that we started developing to help analyze performance across standard C$++$
libraries.

We will discuss the performance issues we are currently working on:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Suboptimal parsing of numbers in libc$++$::stringstream
\item Suboptimal libc$++$::std::sort
\item Range checked access, for vectors (vector::at), is not properly optimized
  by the compiler
\item Missing function attributes like \_\_attribute\_\_(noreturn)
\end{enumerate}

For each of the performance issues that we have found, we will suggest possible
solutions we are working on like improving the implementation or improved
compiler optimizations (inlining extern templates, loop idiom recognition, loop
rotation etc.)

If time permits, we will also present the lessons learnt as a result of
analyzing C$++$ standard libraries like things to look out for while using
standard C$++$ libraries, for example:\
\begin{enumerate}
\item Instead of std::rotate for std::list we can just exchange few pointers.
\item Issue with the destructor of std::string
\item Performance issues while using most commonly used containers such as
  std::vector, std::string
\end{enumerate}

Keywords: libc$++$, libstdc$++$, C$++$, performance analysis, function attributes
