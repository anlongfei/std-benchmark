- Going into a description of how you discovered the issues and tools that you used to profile the problem would be really helpful.

- What led you to look at this issue?
  Performance analysis of benchmarks

- How did you know that there was a potential speed gain to be had?
  Optimizing for locality

- How to effectively use tools to determine where to optimize or how to optimize?
  Valgrind, ltrace, linux perf (Basic tutorial of each of these)

- Don't be afraid to go into detail.

- Remember that, as a tutorial, people will be using your slides as an outline for how they can use your methodology in their own code.
- If there's not enough content for them to do it on their own, a tutorial that just says "there was a problem and I fixed it" isn't going to be very helpful.
- I'd hazard a guess and say that 99% of the people you'll be in front of won't have any experience with compiler internals or GLIBC internals.
- That's why I'd move the focus away from the specific GLIBC internals and towards optimization in general.
    Carve out general code from the examples

- I think that there's some extremely valuable information here that you can share with the audience, but you don't want them to get lost because they don't know GLIBC.
